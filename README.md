#  IIIF Assignment

I have created my own IIIF manifest that I have annotated for my English assignment. I have followed the online IIIF Tutorial, prepared by the IIIF Technical Coordinator Glen Robson.

## My project

I have created a historical fresco, composed of newspaper articles from the late 19th century, about media coverage and journalistic engagement during the A. Dreyfus affair. I have used resources from Gallica.
In this repository you will find my IIIF manifest with the annotations' files.
